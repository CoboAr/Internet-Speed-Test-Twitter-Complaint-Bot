## What is Speed Test Twitter Complaint Bot?   
It is a python bot created with Selenium that checks the internet speed of the user's internet provier. Next, it logs in on X (formerly named Twitter) and it creates a twit with the user's downloading/uplading speed by tagging the Internet Provider company.   

## How does it work?

Step 1. Sign up for a Twitter account here: https://twitter.com/i/flow/signup   
Step 2. Use [this speedtest](https://www.speedtest.net/) website to get your current live download and upload speeds manually. e.g.     

Step 3. Update Environment variables with your Twitter account credentials.
